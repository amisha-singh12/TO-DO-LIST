# 🌱 Mini Projects 🌟
Welcome to my coding journey repository! 🎉 This is a collection of my newbie experiences as I take my first steps in the world of coding. Here, you'll find a variety of mini projects, from web development 🌐 to simple games 🎮 and other fun experiments 💡 that have helped me grow as a developer.

Each project represents a milestone 📈 in my learning, and I'm excited to share them with you! Feel free to explore 🕵️‍♂️, tinker around 🛠️, and if you have any feedback or ideas, I’d love to hear them! 💬
